#### Course Description
This is an introductory course to statistics and R programming for VNUK students. The material is offered in 5 modules, each containing a lecture and practicum in tutorial class. For practical exercises, we will use the R programming language and R Studio (with interface). The R part is offered in 4 slow-paced tutorials for beginners. However, this course is focused on statistics rather than R; therefore, each practicum is designed with the purpose to demonstrate and reinforce understanding of concepts introduced in the lecture rather than to provide training in R.
